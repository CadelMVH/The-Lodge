Welcome to The Lodge – A Tiny Home with a Grand Vision
Tucked neatly into just under 400 square feet, The Lodge by Golden West (DPS 331M) proves that great things truly do come in small packages. 
At 11’10” wide and 33’ long, this Park Model home is designed with intention, efficiency, and a style that whispers “retreat” from the moment you see it.

Exterior Charm
With a sleek, modern profile and a gently sloped roofline, The Lodge looks right at home whether nestled in a pine-covered hillside or set beside a sparkling coastal inlet. 
The dark-toned siding contrasts beautifully with crisp white trim, giving it a contemporary edge that still feels grounded in nature.
Large, vertical windows span nearly the entire front façade — not just to impress from the outside, but to flood the interior with light and connect you with the landscape just beyond the glass.

Inside the Lodge: Thoughtful, Open, Light-Filled...
Step inside and the first thing you’ll notice is the open layout. The kitchen greets you with stone-inspired countertops, stainless steel appliances, and cabinetry in a soft, earthy green 
— the perfect middle ground between rustic and modern. It’s a space built for function, yet it doesn’t sacrifice form.
Look to the right, and you're embraced by a wall of windows that curve gently, creating a cozy breakfast nook or reading space bathed in natural light.
The floors mimic the look of weathered wood, giving the home a lodge-like warmth that balances the fresh, minimalist interior.
The kitchen island is more than a prep space — it’s a place to sip coffee, work remotely, or host a casual dinner for two.

The Story It Tells
The Lodge isn’t just a Park Model — it’s a state of mind. A simplified lifestyle. A declaration that you don’t need more square footage to live largely. 
It’s a place for slow mornings, creative afternoons, and quiet nights under a big sky. 
Whether it’s a full-time dwelling or a weekend escape, this home invites you to pause, breathe, and belong.
